<!-- ## About the Project

This webpage highlights our work on enhancing coverage control using real-time map feedback, integrating angle-aware coverage with real-time map feedback from [NeuralRecon](https://zju3dv.github.io/neuralrecon/). Our method leverages this feedback for improved 3D reconstruction and control using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). -->
